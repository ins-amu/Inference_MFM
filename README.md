This is a repo to make inference on a mean-filed model of spiking QIF neurons, using Optimization (DE/PSO), Simulation-based Inference (SBI), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), and Neural ODEs.

Based on our benchmark, we recommend using SBI for inference on generative parameters. Please refer to the folder <em>SBI for a demonstration.

To infer the dynamics from simulations, particularly to learn vector fields and nullclines (travesering across scales), refer to <em> Neural ODEs.
