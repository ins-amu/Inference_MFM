This repository implements the recovery of hidden r_star from its observed counterpart v_star using time-delay embedding -based regression on simulated data from the (assumed known) generative model. 

We start by simulating series {(r_i, v_i)} i=1,...,N=100 from the known generative model, with values of parameters picked randoomly inside an acceptable range (yielding different stability regimes: stable node, stable focus, bistabiltiy). Then, we learn regression weights that map the nearest neighbours of the {**time delay embedded** v_i[t]}_i to their image (i.e., matching indices) in the {r_i[t]}_i (non time delay embeded). Ultimately, we predict the approximation hat_r_star[t] of r_star[t] from {time delay embedded v_star[t]} using the learned regression weights.
