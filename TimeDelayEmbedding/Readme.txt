This repository implements the recovery of hidden $r$ from its observed counterpart $v$ using time-delay embedding -based regression on simulated data from the (known) generative model. We predict r_star when having only v_star by regressing on neighbours of v_star[t] in a set of simulated series (v_i, r_i), ultimately retrieving the corresponding hat_r_star[t] from the (r_i[t])s.
